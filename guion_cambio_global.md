## Objectives

This session will help us contextualize the effect that global change has on the management techniques of socio-ecosystems. We will see how, in recent decades, the impacts caused by our activities transcend the local level and affect the entire planet. This allows us to define the concept of global change. More specifically, the educational objectives are:

+ To distinguish between local and global impacts, which arise from the repetition of the former.
+ To learn to recognize the global consequences of human activity.
+ To understand how global change also has consequences for how we manage socio-ecosystems at the local scale.
+ To verify how the above is included in the concepts of global change and Anthropocene.
+ To understand the relationships between global change and biogeochemical cycles, specifically the relationship between fossil fuel combustion and climate change.

## Contents

Throughout the session, we will discuss how the extension of human civilization across the planet results in the impacts of our activities no longer being local, but affecting the entire system.

We will begin by describing the concept of the "great acceleration," referring to the exponential increase in the use of natural resources by Humanity. This creates a confrontation with the physical limits of the planet. This will allow us to understand the concept of "planetary boundary."

The next key concept is "global change," understood as the set of alterations that human activity causes on the functioning of the planetary system as a whole.

Finally, we will summarize all of the above in the concept of Anthropocene, which many authors define as a new geological era in which humans govern the functioning of the Earth System.
